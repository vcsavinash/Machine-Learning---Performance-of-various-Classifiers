# Machine-Learning---Performance-of-various-Classifiers

Compare performance of classifiers on a chosen dataset. Below is the list of classifiers:
  • Decision Trees                                                                                                                           • Perceptron 
  • Neural Net
  • Deep Learning
  • SVM
  • naïve Bayes
  • Logistic Regression
  • k-Nearest Neighbors
  • Bagging
  • Random Forests
  • AdaBoost
  • Gradient Boosting

The idea is to choose a single dataset and run all of these classifiers on that dataset using the best set of parameters for each case, and then compare their performance. 

NOTE: The Report report.pdf contains the Performance Comparisons of various Classifiers.
